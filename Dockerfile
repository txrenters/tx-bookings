# Production image for tx-bookings on the shared company VPS.
#
# The pattern is texra-crm's, which came from corepath-website by way of tx-cma
# and tx-scoreboard. Keep the two in step: this app sits on the same box, uses
# the same host mysqld over its socket, and is proxied by the same nginx.
#
# Two bases on purpose:
#   build   - Debian, because the Wayfinder Vite plugin shells out to
#             `php artisan`, so the asset stage needs PHP *and* Node, and
#             Debian's toolchain for that is the least surprising.
#   runtime - Alpine, because nothing compiled in the build stage ships
#             forward. vendor/ is pure PHP and public/build is static.
#
# PHP is pinned to 8.4 to match the VPS and the apps already containerised on
# it. composer.json requires ^8.3, so nothing forces a newer runtime -- note
# that local development runs 8.5, so anything relying on an 8.5-only feature
# will pass locally and fail here.

# Stage 1: dependencies and frontend assets.
