# Docker Compose has no rolling update of its own: `up -d` stops a container
# before starting its replacement, which is a visible outage. This script does
# what Swarm/Kubernetes would -- start replacements alongside the old
# containers, wait for them to report healthy, and only then retire the old
# ones. nginx picks up the change from Docker's DNS, so traffic moves over
# without a gap.
#
# Rolled this way:   app       (user-facing)
# Plainly recreated: web, queue, scheduler
#   Two schedulers running at once would double-fire scheduled commands, and
#   bookings:send-reminders runs every five minutes -- invitees would get the
#   same reminder twice. A few seconds without a background worker is not
#   user-visible.
