     * never fills in a registration form, so the account is built from what the
     * invitation already knows. Like CreateTeamUser, and unlike CreateNewUser,
     * it creates NO personal organization — the user is being placed into an
     * existing one, and a second org would only clutter their switcher.
     *
     * No password is chosen here either. The account gets a throwaway secret
     * and the user sets their own from settings/security, so a usable password
     * never passes through a link or the logs.
