     * Create a user directly inside an existing organization.

     * This is the super admin's alternative to an invitation: the account
     * exists immediately, already a member, with no self-service signup. No
     * password is ever chosen for the user — the account is created with a
     * throwaway secret and they set their own via the reset link, so a usable
     * password never passes through the creator's hands or the logs.
     *
     * Unlike CreateNewUser this does NOT create a personal organization. The
     * user is being placed into an existing one, and a second personal org
     * would just clutter their switcher.
