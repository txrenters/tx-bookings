# Mail

## Mail goes out through Graph because the sender is a shared mailbox
bookings@texasrenters.com is a shared M365 mailbox: no licence, no password, sign-in blocked, so it cannot authenticate to SMTP. MicrosoftGraphTransport posts to /users/{mailbox}/sendMail with an app-only client-credentials token instead of signing in as the mailbox.

Mail has its OWN Azure app registration (MAIL_GRAPH_TENANT / _CLIENT_ID / _CLIENT_SECRET on the mailer's config in config/mail.php), separate from the calendar's services.microsoft.*. It holds the Mail.Send APPLICATION permission with admin consent — a permission that sends as a mailbox with no user present — so it gets its own secret to rotate. Narrow it to this one mailbox with an Exchange application access policy, or it can send as every mailbox in the tenant. The keys fall back to the calendar's registration for a setup that runs both from one app.

MAIL_GRAPH_TENANT must name the real tenant. The calendar's user sign-in flow accepts the multi-tenant 'common' placeholder and MICROSOFT_TENANT is deliberately left on it; client credentials cannot, since there is no user to resolve the tenant from. AppServiceProvider::registerMicrosoftGraphMailer() rejects 'common' rather than letting the token request fail at send time.

The fallbacks use `?:`, not env()'s second argument: these keys ship present-but-empty in .env.example, and env() returns '' for those, so a default would never be reached. The same trap is why the provider checks blank() on every key instead of trusting config to be filled.

Like the calendar providers, this is plain Http facade calls, no microsoft-graph SDK, so tests use Http::fake(). A Graph message holds one body: an email with both parts sends as HTML and the plain text alternative is dropped.
